node-xignite, minimally-functional Xignite Web Services example in node
=======================================================================

Nothing much to see here, just a demo/example of using NodeJS to query very basic market data from [Xignite][1], using NodeJS. I've got some cool thing in the works for consuming this sort of data, but for the moment, it's just an example of how to use the JSON request handler to easily parse web service responses.
